They say I'm different, they don't understand
But there's a bigger problem that's much more in demand
You got world hunger, not enough to eat
So there's really no time to be trippin' on me
You got school teachers who don't wanna teach
You got grown people who can't write or read
You got strange diseases, ha, but there's no cure
You got many doctors that aren't so sure
So tell me (why)
Why you wanna trip on me
(Why, why, why)
(Why do you wanna)
Why you wanna trip on me
(Why)
Stop trippin'
We've got more problems than we'll ever need
You got gang violence and bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people with no food to eat
With no clothes on their back and no shoes for their feet
We've got drug addiction in the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption, police brutality
We've got streetwalkers walkin' into darkness
Tell me, what are we doin' to try to stop this?
Why you wanna trip on me
(Why, why, why)
(Why) Why you wanna trip on me
(Why, why, why) Tell me
Why you wanna trip on me
(Why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me
You stop trippin', they stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'
Why you wanna trip on me
(Why, why, why)
(Why) Why you wanna trip on me
(Why, why, why) Don't you trip on me, brother
Baby, whoa-oh
Why you wanna trip on me
(Why) No, no, no, no, no, don't trip on me, brother
(Why) Baby
Why you wanna trip on me
(Why) No, no, no, no, you need to understand it (stop trippin')
Tell me
Why you wanna trip on me (tell me)
(Why, why, why) Don't you trip on me, brother
Tell me, tell me
Why you wanna trip on me (why)
(You can't, you can't, you can't understand it)
Why you wanna trip on me
(Why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me
You stop trippin', they stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
(Trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin')
(Trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin')
Stop trippin'
(Trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin')
(Trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin')
Stop trippin'
