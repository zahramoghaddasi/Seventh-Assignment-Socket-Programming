… When Moses walked the children out of Egypt land
He said now don't you worry, we're in the Lords' hands
He's gonna walk beside us, the time is coming near
He's gonna wash away all our misery and our fear
… I got a feeling in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
… When Daniel faced the lion, there wasn't any doubt
We've got to be like Daniel and the Lord will help us out
… I got a feeling in my body
This will be our lucky day, oh yeah
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
… Won't you lift your eyes up, children? Lift 'em to the sky
Heaven stands before you, gates are open wide
Shelter for the weary, comfort for the weak
We'll leave the devil's evil, sweatin' on the street
… I got a feeling in my body
This will be our lucky day, oh yeah
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way, yeah
… Won't you lift your eyes up, children? Lift 'em to the sky
Heaven stands before you, gates are open wide
Shelter for the weary, comfort for the weak
We'll leave the devil's evil, sweatin' on the streets
… I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a
I got a feeling in my body
This will be our lucky day, oh yeah
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way, yeah
… I got a feeling in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way, yeah
